### What I learned

```html

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code i learned more<h1>
<p>
  -button : learn about simplyfying link with just pressing butttons
  -class : a little bit of class
  not much on the html tbh
</p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
